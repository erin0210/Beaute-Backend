PROJECT TITLE : Beauté  (BEAUTY TRENDS APPLICATION)

PROJECT SYNOPSIS :

This application (Beauté) is a beauty trends - social media application that provides 
the easiest way to learn about potentially toxic cosmetics and personal care products. 
It lessens the burden that consumers face by allowing them to pick products based on              
the scale of cleanliness and dirtiness. The scale will be based on reviews made by              
consumers who have used the product. It will also allow us to compare products              
when shopping based on the tremendous amount of product options available in the             
database based on their popularity and availability in the local market. 
Users of this application can also chat and interact with other users to know more
about others' perception towards a product and find out if it is suitable for them.            
Consumers can also submit new products for admins to consider updating on the              
database just by scanning the barcode on the product. This application will allow             
users to easily understand the info on the product and provide ease in shopping,
reduce doubts or misconceptions on any of the products as well as allowing cosmetic
lovers to interact and share their thoughts on the products they consume.
